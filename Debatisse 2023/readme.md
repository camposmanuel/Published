## Associated scripts and files
In this study, we developped a Python script to analyze the information content of randomized libraries at the 2 arms of the recombination site recognized by the integrase of mv4.
This analysis uses multiple packages, some of which are not built-in Python packages.

Read counts per heptamers for each randomized bank are provided as *.tsv files organized according to the format:
#Sequence \t before \t after \t nt1 \t nt2 \t nt3 \t nt4 \t nt5 \t nt6 \t nt7

The terms before and afetr refer to the recombination event with mv4 integrase.

## Ackowlegements
We used the python package [seqlogo](https://github.com/betteridiot/seqlogo) to generate sequence logos produced in the figures of this manuscript.
